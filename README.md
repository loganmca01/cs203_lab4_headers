Header files for computer organization lab 4, unable to post full code as lab is still being given.

from lab assignment:

"Create a text-based calculator using memory units called registers to store your results and instructions you enter
to perform work upon these memory units."

This lab was focused around building fetch-decode-execute cycle for a toy assembly calculator. No string.h or built in string functions allowed, we were required to build any string parsing or comparison functions ourselves. Registers were represented as binary strings. Addition, subtraction, bitwise & |, negation, and shifts were all implemented by going character by character through strings. No stack, just registers in simulated environment.
